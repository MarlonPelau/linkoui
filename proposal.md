# linkoui
For my 'Front End Portfolio Project' the title is a playful combo based on originally patterning a particular artist's linktr.ee page, and a play on some Trini lingo.

The purpose, functionality and idea behind this app, is for users and vistors to find alternative words that rhyme. A user can be stuck on the variety of words that rhyme with one another, come to the app and find many matches.

As an example -- say one types in 'flan' looking for other words to rhyme with it, a variety of other words result, such as 'van', 'tan', 'ban', 'Uzbekistan' and many more!

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to use words I've never used before when rhyming.
2. As a user, I want to be able to discover new words, broaden my vocabulary in rhyme.
3. As a user, I want to be able to hit submit w/out receiving error or blank results.
4. As a user, I want to explore/exhaust/obsess on ALL rhyme options: a one-stop-shop!
5. As a user, I want smooth-functional transitions from search words to rhyme matches.

### API
A few options from this list: https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/ (without attempting, there's a few that might work -- will need some guidance). This seemed to be one, but no: 
https://openwhyd.github.io/openwhyd/API
The exact patterning of my app, has some github info on its API:
https://github.com/keosariel/Linktree-API so I boiled it down to Linktree's API, but because I have no key, I referred to this link: https://api-ninjas.com/ to find my final option for my project (RHYME): https://api-ninjas.com/api/rhyme
