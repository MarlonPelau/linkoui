# linkoui
An app to provide immediate match-results for users, to find several alternative words that rhyme with the search word they've entered.

## PURPOSE
My "linkoui" app project aims to target the avid rhymer, or wordsmith. Not necessarily just targetting rappers or emcees, it also points to poets, spoken word artists, lovers of poems, and folks who just like to use decorate their jargon or for even idle minds that rhyme for the sake of riddling. The power of words, especially in rhyme, is unmistakeable! It's been the proven format in almost all modern day songwriting. There aren't many megahit songs, that don't incorporate rhyme-patterns throughout their versus, chorus-hooks and more recently, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Hip-Hop in 2023, undoubtedly rhyming has been the catalyst in leading the hip-hop genre to the forefront and also creating a multi-billion dollar industry.

#### Stretch Goals

-Stretch goals to avoid loop-holes?!? To keep with my theme, sure -- let's explore!
1. Initially added a wireframe (lo-fi) which can be found in the proposal.md file.
2. Split my CSS into multiple files, each relating to different functionailities.
3. MY own stretch goal include using the 'marquee' tags for text effect, adding movement; explored using .gif images instead of regular .jpeg images, again for movement as well as visual stimulation, and also hyperlinked them for functionality.
